 🧠 AI-Based Handwritten Digit Recognition System

This project is a web-based AI system that can recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from uploaded images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It uses a custom-trained model based on your real digit dataset to improve accuracy over standard MNIST models.

- Upload handwritten digit images (.png, .jpg)
- Preprocessing pipeline (grayscale, resize, binarization, centering)
- Trained CNN using your own dataset (custom `data/` folder)
- Confidence score returned with each prediction
- User-friendly web interface built with Flask
- Deployed using Google Colab + Ngrok
